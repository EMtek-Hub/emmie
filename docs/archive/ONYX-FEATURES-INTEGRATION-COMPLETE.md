## Known Issue - OpenAI API Key

The chat responses are not generating because the OpenAI API key in `.env` is set to a placeholder:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

**To fix this**, replace with a valid OpenAI API key in your `.env` file.

   - Select different assistants
   - Verify the assistant context switches

2. **Test / Commands**:
   - Type `/` in the chat input
   - Select a prompt template
   - Verify it inserts the full prompt text

3. **Test File Uploads**:

   - Paste images from clipboard
   - Click the attachment button to select files

4. **Test Assistant Sidebar**:
   - Click on assistants in the sidebar
   - Verify selection changes
   - Test the collapsible sections

## Next Steps

1. **Set OpenAI API Key**: Update the `.env` file with a valid API key
2. **Test Chat Generation**: Verify messages generate properly
