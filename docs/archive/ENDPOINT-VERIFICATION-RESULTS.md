# Agent Endpoint Verification Results

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** Last 24 hours (24 messages analyzed)

## üîç Key Finding: Configuration Mismatch Detected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue Identified

**IT Support Agent is falling back to Emmie instead of using OpenAI Assistant**

- **Configuration:** `openai_assistant` mode with Assistant ID `asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h`
- **Actual Usage:** All 16 recent messages used model `gpt-5` (Emmie endpoint)
- **Expected:** Messages should have model `openai-assistant:asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h`

This indicates the OpenAI Assistant endpoint is not working and the system is falling back to Emmie.

- **Runtime Issues:** 1 agent (IT Support falling back)

## üìà Usage Analysis (Last 24 Hours)

### IT Support (Configured for OpenAI Assistant)
- **Messages:** 16
- **Emmie Usage:** 16 (100%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Assistant Usage:** 0 (0%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Model:** `gpt-5` (should be `openai-assistant:asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h`)

### General Assistant (Configured for Emmie)
- **Messages:** 8  
- **Emmie Usage:** 8 (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Assistant Usage:** 0 (0%) ‚úÖ
- **Model:** `gpt-5` (correct)

## üö® Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Debug IT Support OpenAI Assistant Integration

**The IT Support agent is not using its configured OpenAI Assistant. Investigate:**

- Check console logs for error messages when IT Support agent is used
- Verify the assistant ID `asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h` exists in OpenAI dashboard
- Test the assistant ID manually with OpenAI API
- Review any API key or authentication issues

### 2. Test Drafting Assistant

**The Drafting Assistant hasn't been used recently. Test:**

- Send a test message to Drafting Assistant
- Verify it uses `openai-assistant:asst_CxsVNXf0IJilwGwCwyWVmmF9` model
- Check for similar fallback issues

### 3. Monitor Console Logs

When testing, look for these log patterns:

**‚úÖ Correct OpenAI Assistant Usage:**
```
ü§ñ Using OpenAI Assistant: asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h for agent: IT Support
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback to Emmie:**
```
üöÄ Using GPT-5 Responses API with model: gpt-5
```

## üîß Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Assistant IDs in OpenAI Dashboard
1. Log into OpenAI platform
2. Navigate to Assistants section
3. Confirm these assistants exist:
   - `asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h` (IT Support)
   - `asst_CxsVNXf0IJilwGwCwyWVmmF9` (Drafting Assistant)

### Step 2: Test Assistant API Access
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2"
```

### Step 3: Enable Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor live usage
node scripts/monitor-agent-routing.js monitor

# Send test message to IT Support agent while monitoring
```

### Step 4: Check Error Logs
Look for errors in your application logs when using IT Support agent:
- OpenAI API errors
- Assistant not found errors
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting issues

## üîç Code Investigation Areas

### 1. Check `pages/api/chat.ts`
Look at the `handleOpenAIAssistantChat` function around line 400+ for:
- Error handling in OpenAI Assistant integration
- Fallback logic when assistant fails
- Console error messages

### 2. Review Error Handling
The system may be silently failing and falling back to Emmie. Check for:
- Try-catch blocks that suppress errors
- Missing error logging
- Incomplete assistant validation

### 3. Environment Variables
Verify these are properly set:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` 
- Assistant API access permissions

## üìã Next Steps Checklist

- [ ] Test IT Support agent with real-time monitoring active
- [ ] Check OpenAI dashboard for assistant existence
- [ ] Review application error logs
- [ ] Test Drafting Assistant to see if issue is systemic
- [ ] Fix identified issues and re-test
- [ ] Run verification scripts again to confirm fixes

## üí° Monitoring Recommendations

### Daily Verification
```bash
node scripts/verify-agent-endpoints.js
```

### Real-Time Testing
```bash
node scripts/monitor-agent-routing.js monitor
```

### Weekly Analysis
```bash
node scripts/monitor-agent-routing.js usage "7 days"
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

**IT Support agent fixed when:**
- Console shows: `ü§ñ Using OpenAI Assistant: asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h for agent: IT Support`
- Database shows model: `openai-assistant:asst_kfOnuCYnMc47cN8IY11WSH1h`
- No fallback to `gpt-5` model
- Real-time monitoring shows ‚úÖ correct endpoint usage
